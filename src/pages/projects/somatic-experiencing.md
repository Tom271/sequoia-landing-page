# Somatic Experiencing
## What is SE? 

SE is a body-centred approach to healing PTSD and trauma rather than focusing on our cognitive thoughts or emotions associated with a traumatic event. It was spearheaded by Dr Peter Levine who believes that nobody will go through their lives without encountering trauma. He says “Trauma is a fact of life. It does not, however, have to be a life sentence”. 

 

SE believes that trauma demands a physical release in the body and that we must all go through a survival response, much like animals in the wild. When we thwart that natural response and use our higher brains to ignore, push away or override this response, the stage is set for PTSD to take hold. Depending on our life building blocks and our experiences, this energy could become stuck in our body leaving us in a perpetual state of fight-or-flight. This can present itself in many ways and you may have accepted this as a part of your identity, depending on how long you have lived with it. SE teaches us how to observe these responses and release the trauma from the body. SE is not a quick fix, it is a lifestyle, an awareness, a daily practice. Once you begin to notice your body, it becomes difficult to ignore it.  

 

What is a typical session like?  

No two sessions are the same but we will follow some basic principles each session. We are working with the body, sensations, experience. We are trying to avoid involving the cognitive brain too much as the more cognition we use, the less we listen to the body.  

 

I am in training to complete my SE training and will be fully qualified by 2026. I am allowed to offer SE sessions under the conditions that you know I am in training. This will be reflected in the price.
