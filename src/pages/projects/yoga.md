<h1 class="text-orange font-sans"> Yoga</h1>

I am offering one-to-one or group yoga tutoring either in person or over zoom.

Yoga is an ancient practice offering more than just movement but a full lifestyle experience. When we choose to live in alignment with yoga principles we choose ourselves, our health and our happiness.

I work with Hatha yoga mostly and generally suggest we have a 90 minute class so you can really get the full experience. My yoga classes will draw on many components of yoga; philosophy, meditation, breathwork, movement and deep relaxation. Depending on your experience we will work in a gentle, progressive way, working with your needs and body. I will be assessing and monitoring your progress and tailoring each session to how you are. My aim with yoga is to not only improve your physical practice but teach you ways of living with yoga and improving your mental wellbeing. Slowly but surely you will start to notice differences in your body and your mind.

In-person tutoring is by far the most effective and impactful way to learn however I am continually surprised by how much can be achieved over zoom. This can be a wonderful way to reach people who feel unable to leave their homes or do not have the confidence to go to a studio class.

In person: £35 per hour (+£5 if more than one person, max 4)
